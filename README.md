# Spambase-SGD-Logistic-Regression

In this project, logistic regression implemented from scratch with mini-batch SGD for a binary classification on the UCI Spambase dataset. This dataset consists of 4,601 emails and 57 features. The small training set size of 5\% is deliberately chosen in order to emphasize the overfitting challenges, and to demonstrate the value of L2 regularization and hyperparameter tuning.
